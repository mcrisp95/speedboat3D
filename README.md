# Speedboat3D

## Source Code
The C# file \Assets\Scripts\BoatMovement.cs is written by me
The image file \Assets\Materials\water.png was downloaded from https://opengameart.org/sites/default/files/brushwalker218.png
The Unity game files Water.mat and MainScene.unity were made by me with Unity engine

## Running the game
If you have the Unity browser plug-in installed, you can use the WebGL build by opening \Builds\WebGL\index.html
If you do not have the above plug-in, you can run the Windows version by opening \Builds\x86\Speedboat3D.exe

##Controls
W/S : Accelerate forwards and backwards
A/D : Turn left/right. NOTE: This only works when the boat is stationary, due to the criteria explained for the test
